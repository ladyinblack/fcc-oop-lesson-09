### [Understand Own Properties](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/understand-own-properties)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
In the example code given you will see a new array `ownProps[]` initialised followed by a `for...in` statement to loop through the properties of `duck` and then use a `push()` statement to fill in the new array.  The same method must be followed for the `canary` object.

Simply replace the `duck` object in the `for...in` statement with the `canary` object to pass all test cases.
